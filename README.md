PopPoly, version 1, Ehsan Motazedi (ehsan.motazedi@gmail.com), last modified: June 13 2018

Introduction
============

**PopPoly** \(executable *main.py*\) is a tool for haplotype estimation in polyploid F1 populations. PopPoly uses all of the population reads to estimate the maximum likelihood parental haplotypes, from which offspring haplotypes are selected using the MEC criterion.

The algorithm is based on a Bayesian framework to choose the most likely parental haplotypes using sequence reads, and applies Mendelian inheritance rules, assuming no recombination between the SNPs, to weight each candidate phasing for the parents and to later choose the offspring phasings from the parental haplotypes. It can also re-assign the dosages for all or missing SNPs using the Mendelian rules and sequence reads.

PopPoly is written in *Python* and is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
